## 📦 Model Note

**⚠️ Note:** The trained GPT-2 model is **not included** in this repository due to size limitations.

To use the app:
- Fine-tune a GPT-2 model or use your trained checkpoint.
- Place all related files (`pytorch_model.bin`, tokenizer files, `config.json`, etc.) inside the `/model` folder.

For hosting large files, consider:
- Hugging Face Hub  
- Google Drive with `gdown`  
- Git LFS or Weights & Biases artifacts
